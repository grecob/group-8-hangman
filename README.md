# group-8-hangman
Project Description: The project allows users to play the well-known game hangman. It will be represented as stickman slowly gaining limbs while the player guesses until it is a completed stickman. It will show the player how many guesses they've made and what guesses were wrong. The development is center on using a Python-based graphical user interface, and adding features to allow the user to customize how they play. Features will hopefully include, stickman customization, background, different difficulties and categories of words. The goal is to create a fun or at least entertaining application.
